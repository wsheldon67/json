When activated, the cleric charges the weapon with positive or negative energy (as appropriate) so it deals extra damage when it hits a target. This functions like the Channel Smite feat, except the additional damage is equal to half the cleric's channel energy damage (the target makes a Will save as normal, based on the cleric's channel energy DC).

A monk or paladin of the cleric's faith may concentrate upon an activated meditation crystal, taking no actions for 1 minute, and regain 1 ki point or one use of lay on hands.

If two people each wear one of the rings and clasp hands, a cleric may activate both rings with one use of channel energy.

If touched, the focus releases the stored power as if you used channel energy, though it only heals or deals half the normal damage (including all feats and abilities that affect the DC and damage).

            "Sundered mask":{"price":25000,"weight":1,"description":"This mask is a representation of a god of knowledge. Activating the mask charges it with healing power. If a member of the faith associated with the mask wears the mask when it is activated, the first time the wearer takes damage, the mask releases the stored energy into the wearer, healing a number of hit points equal to the number of dice of the activating cleric's channel energy ability. The mask heals its wearer regardless of the type of channeled energy used and whether the target is living or undead. This healing does not prevent the wearer from dying because of hit point damage, and is mainly used to provide instant healing when a cleric is occupied or can only channel a harmful kind of energy.

The glue is sufficient to coat 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 40 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each. Pulling apart a large glued surface (at least 1 square foot) requires a DC 15 Strength check. Pulling apart a small glued surface (anything less than 1 square foot) requires a DC 10 Strength check. Animal glue slowly dissolves in water, reducing the Strength DC needed to break it by 1 per 10 minutes.

Though these stones are often traded away to colder regions or used to keep tents comfortable during the desert nights, magicians and scientists both routinely find new ways to put heatstones to use. Some heatstones are alchemically treated to produce heat that lasts indefinitely or to be used in permanent items (see Heatstone Items). However, common heatstones found in the wilds can be made to function as described below with only a simple alchemical treatment and can be bought at the listed price. Alchemically treated to enhance their natural heat-generating properties, these round or ovoid stones of volcanic glass provide enough heat to keep chambers warm in the coldest winter. One heatstone keeps a 20-foot-square area comfortably warm even in extreme cold (below –20° F), or a 40-foot-square area in severe cold (between 0° F and –20° F). A single heatstone is activated by striking it against any hard surface, after which point it continues to provide heat for 24 hours.

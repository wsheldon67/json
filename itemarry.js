The mask heals its wearer regardless of the type of channeled energy used and whether the target is living or undead.

The price varies depending on the cloak's quality, with the low end being a simple linen cloak and the high end being made of silk or decorated with fur trim.",},
    {"name":"Cloak, Wing","price":120000,"weight":1,"description":"This strange piece of equipment only works for sylphs and similar creatures, whose light, airy bodies can be borne upon the winds. Looking like a fine silk traveler's cloak, a wing cloak is secretly reinforced with a series of wooden struts that, when locked into place, stretch the cloak's fabric into a rudimentary wing. Arranging the struts into a wing or reversing the change is a move action. When the cloak is shaped into a wing, the wearer can make a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if using feather fall. When falling, the wearer may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, moving 5 feet laterally for every 20 feet she falls.

Wearing ice skates allows you to move on ice at normal speed with a successful DC 5 Acrobatics check (including running and charging), but your movement is reduced to half speed on all other terrain. Donning or removing an ice skate is a full-round action. Skating with only one is possible, but the DC of the Acrobatics check rises to 15.",},

Wearing skis allows you to move on snow and ice at normal speed, but your movement is reduced to 5 feet on all other terrain.

    {"name":"Cape, Billow","price":10000,"weight":4,"description":"This silk cape is constructed of many carefully arranged overlapping layers that are loosely stitched together. When exposed to a sudden influx of air, like that caused by falling, the cloak unfolds like a crude parachute. When falling, a creature wearing a billow cape is treated as if he had deliberately jumped from the height. When worn in areas of strong wind or greater, a billow cape hampers movement. In such wind conditions, the wearer treats all terrain as difficult terrain and takes a –4 penalty on Fly checks. Because of the strange and somewhat fragile construction of this cape, only Small or smaller billow capes function properly. Larger billow capes take all the penalties resulting from high winds, but grant none of the benefits when the wearer falls.",},
    {"name":"Eye patch","price":10,"weight":0,"description":"An eye patch covers one eye and ties around the head.

Gloom sight goggles interact with the unique eyes of fetchlings in such a way that when the goggles are worn over both eyes, they expand the range of a fetchling's darkvision to 90 feet, but the fetchling also gains the light sensitivity weakness. Other races cannot see through the lenses of these goggles, and they have no affect on fetchlings whose eyes have been modified by the Gloom Sight feat.

    {"name":"Mask, Monster","price":700,"weight":1,"description":"This articulated mask resembles a specific type of humanoid monster, such as a bugbear, goblin, orc, or hobgoblin. The mouth opens and closes when you move your jaw and its skin is actually carefully-painted cloth. Though such masks are usually intended for theater performances where an actor plays the role of a monster, adventurers have been known to use them to help blend in with monsters of the appropriate type. The mask negates the –2 Disguise DC for disguising yourself as a different race, but only at a distance of at least 20 feet or when you have concealment; closer than this distance or in clearer circumstances, the mask is obviously a false representation. It only covers your face and is normally worn with a wig or helmet to disguise or cover the rest of your head. Each mask is most suitable for a wearer of a particular size, though some size and monster combinations are less believable than others (a Small creature in an orc mask may be able to pass as an orc child, but a Medium creature in a goblin mask at best looks like a deformed hobgoblin).",},

A sun sensitivity outfit prevents creatures with light sensitivity from being dazzled when walking, traveling, or otherwise performing simple acts in areas of bright natural light.

If the scent is upwind, the range at which a catfolk can detect the scent increases to 60 feet; if it is downwind, the range drops to 15 feet. A catfolk with the scent racial quality doubles those distances. A scent impression lasts for 1 year or until it is washed away. Each kit has 10 uses.",},

The glue is sufficient to coat 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 40 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each. Pulling apart a large glued surface (at least 1 square foot) requires a DC 15 Strength check. Pulling apart a small glued surface (anything less than 1 square foot) requires a DC 10 Strength check. Animal glue slowly dissolves in water, reducing the Strength DC needed to break it by 1 per 10 minutes. It softens if heated, even with steam, reducing the Strength DC needed to break it by 1 per minute.",},

Though these stones are often traded away to colder regions or used to keep tents comfortable during the desert nights, magicians and scientists both routinely find new ways to put heatstones to use. Some heatstones are alchemically treated to produce heat that lasts indefinitely or to be used in permanent items (see Heatstone Items). However, common heatstones found in the wilds can be made to function as described below with only a simple alchemical treatment and can be bought at the listed price. Alchemically treated to enhance their natural heat-generating properties, these round or ovoid stones of volcanic glass provide enough heat to keep chambers warm in the coldest winter. One heatstone keeps a 20-foot-square area comfortably warm even in extreme cold (below –20° F), or a 40-foot-square area in severe cold (between 0° F and –20° F). A single heatstone is activated by striking it against any hard surface, after which point it continues to provide heat for 24 hours. An active heatstone does not give off enough heat to cook food or cause damage.",},

Beast whistles come in six different varieties: avian, canine, feline, rodent, reptile, and ungulate (other varieties may be available at the GM's discretion). Animals and magical beasts that match a beast whistle's type can hear the whistle as a human hears a signal whistle. Creatures that fit into multiple categories (such as griffons) can usually hear the call of multiple types of whistles, though magical beasts who don't fit into any of the above categories cannot hear a beast whistle. Beast whistles don't function underwater, except if surrounded by an air bubble or similar effect, though creatures underwater may hear a beast whistle sounded from above the surface if they are close enough.",},

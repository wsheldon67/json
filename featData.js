Some creatures (such as oozes, elementals, and creatures with the incorporeal quality) cannot have bombs implanted in them.

A thanatopic spell that would kill a living creature (such as by giving it negative levels equal to its Hit Dice) destroys an undead (though undead such as ghosts, liches, and vampires may reform as normal).

If you hit (whether or not the attack damages the target), the hammer rebounds off of the creature and lands in your square. If you have the Snatch Arrows feat, you may choose to catch the hammer when it enters your square (though this does not give you the ability to immediately throw the hammer). This ability may not work against some creatures or in certain circumstances as determined by the GM; for example, your weapon does not bounce off incorporeal creatures (unless it has the ghost touch ability), it may stick to creatures with the adhesive ability, the slowing effect of fighting underwater prevents you from using this feat, and so on.",},

If the target is flat-footed, running, or charging, this attack ignores any bonuses to the target's AC from its shield. If the attack hits, you may immediately make a trip attempt against the target as a free action. If you fail to trip your opponent, your opponent does not get an attempt to trip you in return.

Make a Bluff check opposed by a target's Sense Motive check; if you win the check, the target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws made to resist the next spell of this school that you cast. If your chosen school is universalist, choose a specific school each time you use this ability. If your Bluff check succeeds, however, your lack of true commitment to the school means the target takes only a -1 penalty on its saving throw.",},

If the creature fails its check, it agrees to exchange your object for its own. Obvious differences in the value between the exchanged items give your roll a +4 or -4 modifier, at the GM's discretion (offering a clay cup for a jeweled dagger gives your roll a -4 penalty). The GM may rule that some items are too obviously valuable or worthless for this feat to apply (a king wouldn't trade his crown for any item, and no normal person would trade an item for a piece of garbage). If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target is insulted and his attitude toward you worsens by one category. Once the exchange happens, make an Appraise roll opposed by the target's Appraise or Sense Motive roll. If the target wins, it immediately realizes the true value of the object you offered it and behaves accordingly. If you succeed, it believes your false assessment for 1 round; for every 5 by which your check exceeds your opponent's check, the deception lasts 1 more round. As with disbelieving illusions, the target's ally can point out the true value of the object, giving the target another check with a +2 bonus. You cannot use this ability in combat, against a creature whose attitude toward you is hostile or unfriendly, against a creature that does not understand you, or against a creature that has an Intelligence score of 3 or less.",},

Any creature of that type within 60 feet of you must make a Will saving throw or become angered. If an affected creature attacks you, it's treated as if it were using Power Attack (taking a penalty on attack rolls but gaining a bonus on damage rolls). If the creature already has the power attack feat, the attack penalty increases by 1 and the damage bonus increases by 2. These modifiers end when combat ends. This ability does not work on creatures that cannot understand you, though sometimes a simple gesture is sufficient for an intelligent opponent to catch your gist regardless of any language barrier.",},
"938":{"name":"Helpless Prisoner","type":"General","description":"You can talk your way out of most restraints.","prerequisites":"Bluff 5 ranks, Escape Artist 1 rank, gnome.","race":"Gnome","skill":["Bluff",5],"benefit":"When you are restrained or imprisoned, you can make a Bluff check against any one creature within 30 feet in which you emphasize both your own harmlessness and the pain or inconvenience of your current condition. If the creature knows you are dangerous, it adds a +4 bonus to its Sense Motive check. If you win the check, the target does something intended to make you a little more comfortable-or at least shut you up-that gives you a +5 bonus on your next Escape Artist check.",},
"939":{"name":"Invoke Primal Instinct","type":"General","description":"You can use your ability to take the shape of an animal to enhance your Bluff skill, giving yourself an aura of danger or meekness that influences nearby creatures into doing what you want.","prerequisites":"Bluff 1 rank, wild shape class feature, gnome.","race":"Gnome","skill":["Bluff",1],"benefit":"As a standard action, you can pantomime or describe predator- or prey-like behavior, expend one of your uses of wild shape, and make a Bluff check. All creatures within 30 feet that fail a Will save against your Bluff check DC regard you as a figure of either fear or contempt (your choice applies to all affected creatures).

Variables that rely on caster level function according to your caster level, not your familiar's Hit Dice, though your familiar's Intelligence may influence how precisely it can follow your instructions on how to use these spells. Your familiar must be able to speak to cast spells with a verbal component (the ability to speak with its master or creatures of its kind is insufficient). Your familiar must be carrying any material or focus components necessary, unless the materials cost less than 1 gp and the spell is prepared with Eschew Materials. Attack rolls use your familiar's ability scores. A familiar spell counts against the number of spells you may prepare for as long as your familiar retains the spell. Once your familiar casts a retained spell, you can prepare a new spell in that slot the next time you prepare spells. A familiar spell uses up a spell slot 3 levels higher than the spell's actual level.

The creature gains your vampire or dhampir weaknesses and fast healing 5. If you are a vampire, the creature also gains the following abilities, depending on what type of vampire you are. Jiang-Shi: If the creature is adjacent to you or you are sharing a square, it gains the benefit of your prayer scroll ability. The creature crumbles into dust if destroyed ( just like a jiang-shi), but is not permanently destroyed unless measures are taken that would destroy a jiang-shi. Moroi: If the creature is adjacent to or in your square when you assume gaseous form, it transforms with you and follows you; its transformation ends when yours does. If reduced to 0 hit points, it is forced into gaseous form and must return to your coffin to reform (or the foot of your coffin if it cannot fit within it). Nosferatu: If the creature is adjacent to or in your square when you assume swarm form, it transforms with you and follows you; its transformation ends when yours does.

It can be permanently destroyed as if it were a vetala.",},
"993":{"name":"Variant Prayer Scroll","type":"General","description":"You have learned the secret to changing the powers granted by your prayer scroll.","prerequisites":"Jiang-shi.","benefit":"You gain the ability to create a different type of prayer scroll. You may create a prayer scroll with this ability by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Swapping your current prayer scroll for a different prepared one is a standard action. When wearing a different prayer scroll, you gain its special abilities, but lose your normal prayer scroll's immunity to spell completion and spell trigger magic items. Your prayer scrolls can be used only by you, and have no effect when used by other jiang-shis. When you choose this feat, select one of the following prayer scroll types. Embalmed Form: This prayer scroll alters your physical form to how you looked 1 day before your death. Treat this as an alter self spell that affects you regardless of your original or current type; your caster level is equal to your Hit Dice. Your speed increases by 10 feet, but you lose your immunity to trip attacks and your ability to move through difficult terrain unhindered. These effects persist indefinitely as long as you wear the prayer scroll, but end immediately if you use a different prayer scroll or 24 hours after you remove this prayer scroll. Enduring Dust: If you crumble into dust from hit point damage, you reform after 1 round instead of 1 minute. Scattering your dust does not prevent you from reforming as long none of your dust is more than 30 feet from any other part of your dust. Storing a portion of your dust in an air-tight container prevents you from reforming. If you are unable to reform after 1 minute, you are destroyed. Positive Energy Immunity: You become immune to positive channeled energy used to harm undead. This does not protect you against positive energy from other sources such as cure spells or lay on hands. Spell Immunity: The prayer scroll grants you immunity to a spell, as if you were using spell immunity. You decide which spell when you create the prayer scroll, and can choose a different spell each time you create a new spell immunity prayer scroll. If you have 15 or more Hit Dice, this functions as greater spell immunity. Creating this type of prayer scroll costs 100 gp x the spell level of the spell keyed to the scroll.",},

If you are evil or worship an evil deity, whenever you cast a harmful spell on an enemy you gain a +1 profane bonus to AC for 1 round per spell level. Casting a spell on yourself does not count unless it also affects an ally.",},
"1196":{"name":"Truth-Seeker","type":"Story","description":"A tantalizing secret from the past calls to you, and you intend to discover it.","prerequisites":"You must have visited a ruin or forgotten place that has been abandoned for at least five times as long as you've been alive.","benefit":"You gain a +2 bonus on all Knowledge (history) checks.

"1197":{"name":"Object Of Legend","type":"Story","description":"The object of your quest drives you ever forward.","prerequisites":"You must have some highly personal stake in attaining the object of your quest as determined collectively by you and the GM-such as needing an ancestral weapon to exact your revenge against a known betrayer, seeking to destroy the artifact that caused your family's downfall generations ago, or attempting to behead a monster that ravaged your homeland during your youth.","benefit":"When you gain this feat, select one of the quest objects on this page or the facing page, or devise a quest object with your GM based on the quest objects presented in this section. You gain a +2 bonus on any Knowledge checks to gain information on the object of your quest. If you have 10 or more ranks in the Knowledge skill in question, the bonus increases to +4. In addition, once per day when you threaten a critical hit against a foe who specifically aims to stop you from completing your quest, you gain a +10 bonus on your confirmation roll against that opponent. You must announce the use of this ability after threatening the critical hit and before rolling your confirmation roll. This bonus does not stack with bonuses on confirmation rolls from other feats, such as Critical Focus.",},
"1198":{"name":"Center Of Power","type":"General","description":"You have posted loyal followers in the most vital places.","prerequisites":"Leadership score 13, hold a leadership role related to running a kingdom.","benefit":"Choose a building in your kingdom as your center of power, and dedicate one of the followers granted to you by the Leadership feat to overseeing that location. For every kingdom turn in which that follower does nothing but oversee that location, the benefits that building grants to your kingdom's Economy, Fame, Loyalty, and Stability are doubled and any penalties are negated. This feat does not allow a building to grant benefits it does not normally provide, and has no effect on a building's other effects. This feat only applies to one building, and committing multiple followers to this or different buildings has no effect-the selected location is treated as being of particular importance to you, and its uniqueness combined with the follower's loyalty grants it special efficiencies. The same follower does not have to oversee your center of power every month, but you must keep at least one follower dedicated to this location for the entire month to gain this feat's benefits. Once per year, you may change which building is your center of power.",},

For the purposes of retraining, you are always considered to have a retraining synergy with these classes, regardless of your current class. Additionally, retraining any class option takes you half the time it normally would (and thus half the gp cost), though retraining a class still takes the normal amount of time (5 days for a class with which you have synergy, 7 for a class with which you don't). If you take this feat via retraining or replace it with another feat in the same manner, the retraining time takes twice as long as normal in regards to this feat only.",},

This capital must be the same as the focus capital you chose for the Focused Worker feat. However, the cost of the neglected capital, chosen as part of the same Focused Worker feat, increases by half again its normal amount. These changes in price apply to both the purchased cost and the earned cost of the affected forms of capital.",},
"1201":{"name":"Focused Worker","type":"General","description":"Your attention to detail provides you with an excess of some commodities, at the cost of others.","benefit":"You excel at performing skilled work for a certain type of capital, but are less adept at generating another type of capital (see page 78 of Ultimate Campaign). Choose one of the following types of capital to be your focus capital: Goods, Inf luence, Labor, or Magic. Whenever you spend downtime to perform skilled work to gain focus capital, you gain half again the normal amount (rounded down). However, you must also choose a second, separate type of capital from the same list to be your neglected capital. Whenever you spend downtime to perform skilled work to gain neglected capital, you gain only half the amount you normally would. This feat only affects capital you gain by performing skilled work, not capital you might gain by performing unskilled work, purchasing capital, or running a business. For example, say you chose Goods as your focus capital and Magic as your neglected capital. If you spent a day performing skilled work to gain Goods, and the result of your Sleight of Hands skill check is a 33, you would gain 4 Goods (rather than the usual 3 for a result of 30 or higher). However, if you were to spend the following day using your Spellcraft check to perform skilled work and again got a result of 33, you would only gain 2 Magic rather than the usual 3.",},

"1205":{"name":"Natural Ruler","type":"General","description":"You have a special talent for ruling a nation, and take to the task with ease.","prerequisites":"Hold a leadership role related to running a kingdom.","benefit":"Choose an ability score. Any time your leadership role calls for that ability score to affect one of your kingdom's attributes, your modifier to that ability score is treated as being +2 higher. For example, if you choose Charisma and occupy the General or High Priest leadership role, your Charisma modifier to affect your kingdom's stability would be +2 higher than normal. However, if you occupied the Spymaster leadership role-which employs the Intelligence and Wisdom ability scores-this feat would grant no benefit. Additionally, the entire kingdom gains +2 Stability for as long as you occupy a leadership role.",},

To do so, you must have access to the selected spell on a scroll or in a spellbook, and the spell must be on your spell list (even if it is not one of your spells known). This process takes 10 minutes per spell level of the selected spell. You can cast the selected spell a single time, expending the spell slot as though it were a known spell being cast by you. Preparing a spell in this manner expends a scroll but not a spellbook. A spell prepared in this way is considered its actual level rather than the level of the spell slot expended. You can apply metamagic feats to the spell as normal, as long as the spell's actual level plus the increases from metamagic feats is 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast. For example, a 12th-level sorcerer with this feat, a scroll of fireball, and the Empower Spell metamagic feat could prepare an empowered fireball spell in her 6th-level spell slot.",},

Choose one of the following abilities that you identified: damage reduction, energy resistance, or spell resistance. For the next 24 hours you treat the selected ability as if it were 2 lower, to a minimum of 0 (for instance, you would treat DR 5/magic as if it were DR 3/magic). You can only benefit from this feat against one single creature at a time. If you use this feat to adapt your tactics to another individual before 24 hours have passed since you last adapted to a creature, the benefit provided against the first individual ends and is replaced by the benefit against the second individual.

It must be currently affecting you and must grant a choice of options when cast. You change its benefit to a different one from the same list. In order to accomplish this, you must make a successful Spellcraft check (DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell to be altered). The duration of the spell is reduced to half of the spell's remaining duration. For example, a 7thlevel wizard could change her resist energy ( fire) spell with 50 minutes of its duration remaining into resist energy (cold), but the new duration would be 25 minutes. This ability does not change the benefit for any other creatures targeted by the original spell.",},
"1232":{"name":"Planned Spontaneity","type":"General","description":"You have a measure of flexibility when preparing spells.","prerequisites":"Knowledge (arcana) 9 ranks, ability to prepare and cast 4th-level spells.","skill":["K.

Each opponent who is aware of you must succeed at a Sense Motive check (DC equal to the result of your Bluff check). Failure means that an opponent is treated as if it were not aware of you when determining whether it is aware combat has begun. If none of your opponents are aware of you, you may act during the surprise round. If an opponent is effectively unaware of any foes, it cannot act during the surprise round.",},

Pick one school of magic in which you possess the Spell Focus feat-you cast spells from this school of magic at +1 caster level. This bonus stacks with the bonus from Spell Focus. Unfortunately, the bloating side effects increase your girth to such a point that you are constantly under the effects of a medium load-your maximum bonus to AC from Dexterity is +3, you gain an armor check penalty of -3, and your speed decreases as appropriate (generally from 30 feet to 20 feet for a Medium creature).",},

The illusion must be one you retain ongoing control of, such as minor image, and the target must be both visible to you and within or adjacent to the area of your illusion. Using this feat immediately ends the figment's duration. You must either make a melee touch attack or give the target a saving throw (Fortitude or Reflex) to resist the damage (see below). If you choose a melee touch attack, you use your own melee touch attack bonus, and if you miss, the spell deals no damage. If you choose to allow the target a saving throw, a successful save means it takes half damage. The shadowy attack deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level. If the target disbelieves or sees through the illusion, reduce the damage by half. The shadowy attack can deal acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, or slashing damage, but the damage must be appropriate to the illusion. For example, an illusory wall that collapses deals bludgeoning damage with a Fortitude save for half, an illusory swordsman strikes with a melee touch attack deals slashing damage, and an illusory wall of fire deals fire damage with a Reflex save for half.",},
"1463":{"name":"Shadow Grasp","type":"Metamagic","description":"Your darkness spells have substance and bind your foes.","prerequisites":"Tenebrous Spell, Umbral Spell.","prerequisite_feats":"Tenebrous Spell, Umbral Spell","benefit":"When you cast a spell with the darkness descriptor that affects an area, creatures in the area are entangled. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the entangle effect. If the spell does not normally allow a save, a creature can make a Reflex save (DC = the spell's DC if it had a saving throw) to negate the effect. If the spell allows spell resistance, failing to overcome a creature's spell resistance means it is not entangled. An entangled creature remains so as long as it is in the area of the spell and for 1 round after it leaves. A creature that leaves and reenters the area must make a new saving throw to avoid becoming entangled. Creatures that succeed at a save to resist being entangled do not have to make additional saves if they stay within the darkened area. You are never impeded by the effects of your spells modified by this feat. A Shadow Grasp spell uses up a slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.",},
"1464":{"name":"Tenebrous Spell","type":"Metamagic","description":"You blend shadow into your spells, increasing their efficacy at the price of susceptibility to light.","benefit":"When you cast a tenebrous spell in darkness or dim light, the spell's effective caster level and any associated save DCs are increased by 1. Any attempts at dispelling a tenebrous spell in darkness or dim light take a -2 penalty on the dispel check. Casting a tenebrous spell in bright light is difficult, and requires a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the tenebrous spell's effective spell level). Attempts to dispel a tenebrous spell in bright light gain a +4 bonus on the dispel check. You cannot use this feat on spells with the light descriptor. A tenebrous spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level, except in the case of spells with the darkness or shadow descriptor or of the illusion (shadow) subschool; this feat does not change the effective level of those spells (but still counts as using a metamagic feat for all other purposes).",},
"1465":{"name":"Umbral Spell","type":"Metamagic","description":"Targets of your darkness spells radiate darkness.","prerequisites":"Tenebrous Spell.","prerequisite_feats":"Tenebrous Spell","benefit":"An umbral spell gains the darkness descriptor. As long as the spell is in effect, the creature or object affected radiates darkness in a 10-foot radius, reducing illumination similar to the effects of the darkness spell. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches or lanterns, do not increase the light level in this area. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area affected by an umbral spell if they are of a higher level than the umbral spell's unmodified spell level. This effect does not stack with itself or with any other effect that creates darkness. An umbral spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. You cannot use this feat on a spell with an instantaneous duration or a spell that does not target a creature or object.",},
"1466":{"name":"Inscribe Magical Tattoo","type":"Item Creation","description":"You can craft magical tattoos.","prerequisites":"Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos) 5 ranks, caster level 5th.","casterLevel":5,"skill":["Craft",5],"benefit":"You can create magical tattoos, magic items inked directly into the flesh of a willing or helpless creature. Both you and the recipient of the tattoo (if the recipient is not yourself) must be present during the entire tattooing process. Magic tattoos must be placed on a part of the body normally able to hold a magic item slot, but they do not count against or interfere with magic items worn on those slots. A single slot can only hold one magical tattoo (nonmagical tattoos and tattoos acquired from the tattooed sorcerer archetype do not count against this limit). Tattoos may be inscribed on the following slots: belt, body, chest, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, ring (up to two), or wrist. They cannot be inscribed on armor, eye, headband, or shield slots. Magical tattoos are difficult to destroy, though they count as magic items for the purposes of dispel magic. The spell erase can permanently destroy a magical tattoo, but the bearer of the tattoo can resist the spell with a Will save, in addition to the caster needing to make a successful caster level check to erase the tattoo. Physically removing a magical tattoo with a sharp instrument or defacing it with fire or acid can destroy it as well. Doing so is a full-round action that not only requires the target to be willing or helpless, but also provokes attacks of opportunity. At least 2 points of damage per caster level of the tattoo must be dealt to destroy a magical tattoo in this manner. Magical tattoos follow the rules for magic item creation as though they were wondrous items, except that they can use the Craft (calligraphy, paintings, tattoos) skill. New magical tattoos can be researched and designed using the guidelines for pricing new magic items. Magical tattoos are treated as slotless magical items for pricing purposes.",},

This disarm attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You cannot use this ability during the same round as a bull rush attempt made with Shield Slam or with any other abilities that affect how your shield bash works.

The next time you use the firearm you've loaded with this special black powder, the concussive blast knocks you back 5 feet from the direction at which you were aiming. If there is no available space behind you, you brace yourself against the obstacle and do not move from your square. Any creatures within the first range increment of the firearm struck by this attack take damage as normal and must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your gunslinger level + your Int modifier) or be pushed back 10 feet. Creatures within two range increments are pushed back 5 feet, while creatures farther away than this are unaffected by the concussive blast.",},

If using an item that is recognizable as a magical implement (such as a wand or ring), you can trick viewers into thinking you are just using the item as a focus component. Onlookers who have no ranks in Spellcraft have no knowledge of what is genuine spellcasting, and automatically believe you are casting a spell. If an onlooker attempts a Spellcraft check to identify your 'casting,' his check is opposed by your Bluff check. If he succeeds, he realizes the deception. If he fails, he believes you cast the spell. Regardless of the result of that opposed check, he uses the result of that Spellcraft check to identify the 'spell' you cast, except the DC is 20 + the spell's level instead of 15 + the spell's level.",},

Religion",1],"benefit":"By using a divine focus as part of casting, you can cast any spell with a material component costing the value of that divine focus (maximum 100 gp) or less without needing that component. For example, if you use a silver holy symbol worth 25 gp, you do not have to provide material components for an arcane spell if its components are worth 25 gp or less. The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. If the spell requires a material component that costs more than the value of the divine focus, you must have the material component on hand to cast the spell, as normal.",},

This does not alter the position of you or your opponent, but your opponent must attempt a Reflex save against the attack in your place. If your opponent fails, it takes half damage from the attack and you take none; if it succeeds, it takes no damage and you take damage as normal as though you'd failed your saving throw (though this damage is still reduced by abilities such as improved evasion).
